    <summary><a href="https://discord.gg/hyperp">HypeRP</a> (2022-2024) | Techstack: Lua, SQL, React, Vue, Node.js, Typescript</summary><br/>
    HypeRP is one of the biggest polish servers (76k people) on FiveM (platform to GTA V, that allows users created their owns servers, powered by cfx.re). This project was almost maintain entirely by me. I was the first person in Poland (or almost the first) to adapt a server to be stable with more than 500 players at one time. 90% of backend code is created in lua, due to the best support on FiveM. Server uses MariaDB database, which is completely sufficient. HypeRP is consists of a lot of smaller projects (smaller, but could easily be separate projects that should not be shamed). Most of UI, I was created, is developed in React or Vue. Several side projects for HypeRP were developed in Node.js (express.js, discord.js, etc), PHP (wordpress), Docker (for some additional servers), C# (for few modding desktop apps). HypeRP was my first serious project and helps me learn a lot of things. <br/><i>This project is not longer maintained by me</i>

    This project was almost 1:1 copy of iPhone 14 for game purposes. I'd developed this project with my friend for almost 5 months. This project was very big and has taught me a lot (that was almost 3 years ago).

    <summary>Discord Bot for <a href="https://flyprova.pl">flyPL</a> (2023) | Techstack: Node.js, Typescript, Discord.js</summary><br/>
    I created a discord bot for one of the biggest virtual airlines in Poland. The goal of this bot was connect discord with their web platform (e.g. authenticating users, giving / removing roles, setting correct nicknames etc). This project was very small and quick, but fun

    <summary>Archive Projects | Techstack: Nest.js, Next.js, Python, Laravel, Java, Docker</summary><br/>
    Archive projects are projects that have been completed, worked and supported, but due to the lack of further cooperation or a change in the owners' strategy, they are no longer sustained and there is no possibility to use them. I cannot share their code due to the commerciality of the project.<br/><br/>
    <ul>
        <li>Micropayments shop for HypeRP - Techstack: SpringBoot, Next.js, Docker, Nginx<br/><br/>This project was created to optimize process of buying additions on server. Player can buy something on web, and immediately receive it on game server. Although I finished this project, it did not go into production due to the change in cfx's ToS and the ban on monetization through proprietary services. This shop was simple e-commerce shop in next.js for server side rendering, authentication with discord oauth2, admin panel to manage products, payment gateway with Przelewy24. REST API for this shop was created in SpringBoot with MySQL database</li><br/>
        <li>Course platform - Techstack: Laravel<br/><br/>This project was a platform, where users could create courses and other users could read them and learn something. This project was MVP, so code was dirty, due to time limits. I don't know what happened to the project, as I have no contact with the owners.</li><br/>
        <li>Voting app - Techstack: Nest.js, Vue, Docker, MongoDB, Nginx<br/><br/>This project was done for my school to improve the voting process for the school board of education on important issues for the school. Authentication & Authorization was done with Azure (every teacher in this school has email in Microsoft organisation). Director can create issue and all teachers can vote (approve, against, abstained). Everything real time with WebSockets. School don't use project, because of unkown reason</li><br/>
        <li>Maybe I forgot about some projects, because my whole life is coding, so I don't remember all ðŸ˜„</li><br/>

    <summary><a href="https://github.com/SekulDev/url-shortener">url-shortener</a> | Techstack: Go, MongoDB, Redis, HTMX, Docker, Nginx</summary><br/>
    I wanted to try something scalable and simple, so I decided to make this project. While URL shorteners might seem simple, this project serves as a playground for implementing advanced infrastructure, clean architecture, and exploring new technologies. MongoDB is scaling with replica-sets. Redis is used for caching and rate-limiting. I decided to use HTMX, because it's so simple, so try them after works with heavy javascript frameworks was awesome experience. To prevent spamming adding new urls, project uses Google ReCaptcha. Golang servers can be scalable horizontally and Nginx is used for load balancing. Working on this project was a refresher for everyday life. Project has some areas to improve, but due to the fact that it is a side project I don't care that much

    <summary><a href="https://github.com/SekulDev/dratevka">dratevka</a> | Techstack: C</summary><br/>
    After years of coding I realized, that I'd never work in low-level languages like C/C++/Rust, so I decided to try. This project is clone of game from Atari called "Dratewka - The shoemaker" (or something like that), but its console-based remake. Working with such low-level language was very hard firstly. Sometimes you have to take a step back, so done this project was a good decision imo

    <summary><a href="https://github.com/SekulDev/instagram_clone">instagram_clone</a> | Techstack: Vue, Nest.js</summary><br/>
    One of year-end project's in my school was clone of instagram (only auth and images crud), but I decided to make almost 1:1 clone. Due to small amount of time, project hasn't any architecture or clean code. The goal was implement as much features as possible and make UI almost identical like in real Instagram. Project has a lot of areas to improve, so maybe in free time I'll make this project better

    <summary>Work In Progress projects</summary><br/>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/SekulDev/learning_platform">Learning platform</a> - Techstack: Laravel, React, PostgreSQL, Docker, Nginx<br/><br/>
      This project is scalable application make with DDD, hexagonal architecture. The app is a place where teachers can create groups and share lessons for their groups (scheduler publishing lessons in specific time). Writing lessons is very enjoyable, because of full markdown editor (formatting, colourful syntax of languages, paste screenshots etc). Users receive notifications about publishing new lesson. Notifications are scalable with Pusher</li><br/>
      <li>Logs - Techstack: Java (SpringBoot), Python, ElasticSearch, PostgreSQL, Kafka<br/><br/>
      This project is scalable platform, where users can create organisations (and manage people in organisations and their permissions), send logs to them with API, search and filter logs with advanced filters. This project will be make with DDD, hexagonal architecture, CQRS and microservices. The goal of project is try to work with very scalable and distributed application. I'll use the Saga Pattern to take care of data consistency. I want to prepare AWS architecture for this distributed app
    <br/>When I finish the project, it will be open source</li>
